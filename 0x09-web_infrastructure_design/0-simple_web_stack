User Accessing www.foobar.comUser Action: A user types www.foobar.com into their browser and presses Enter.
DNS Resolution:The browser queries a DNS resolver to translate www.foobar.com into an IP address.
The DNS resolver returns the IP address 8.8.8.8, associated with the www A record for foobar.com.

HTTP Request:The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server at 8.8.8.8 over the internet using TCP/IP.

Server Processing:The server, running Nginx, receives the request.
Nginx routes the request to the application server (e.g., PHP-FPM) if dynamic content is needed.
The application server processes the request using the application files (e.g., PHP code).
If required, the application server queries the MySQL database for data (e.g., user profiles, posts).
The application server generates a response (e.g., HTML page), which Nginx sends back to the userâ€™s browser.

Response Display:The browser renders the response (e.g., the webpage) for the user.
